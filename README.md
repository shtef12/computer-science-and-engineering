## About

This is a **solid path** for those of you who want to complete a Computer Science course on your own time, **for free**, with courses from the **best universities** in the World.

In the future, more categories and/or courses will be added to this list or a more advanced/specialized list.

Initially, we will also give preference to MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) type of courses because those courses were created with our style of learning in mind.

## Becoming an OSS student

Your registration for this graduation course will be effectuated after you create your profile in our [students profile](https://github.com/open-source-society/computer-science-and-engineering/issues/28) issue.

> **"How can I do this?"**

Comment in [that](https://github.com/open-source-society/computer-science-and-engineering/issues/28) issue in order to officially enrolling in our course, and make your public commitment!

Use the following model to create your profile:

```
- **Name**: YOUR NAME
- **GitHub**: [@your_username]()
- **Twitter**: [@your_username]()
- **Linkedin**: [link]()
- **Website**: [yourblog.com]()

## Completed Courses

**Name of the Section**

Course|Files
:--|:--:
Course Name| [link]()
```

**IMPORTANT**: add your profile **once** and **after** you **finish** each course you can **return** in that issue and **update** your comment.

**ps**: In the *Completed Courses* section, you should link the repository that contains the files that you created in the respective course.

> **"Why should I do this?"**

By making a [public commitment](http://renewablewealth.com/articles/the-power-of-a-public-commitment/), we have much more chances to **succeed** in our graduation, know better our fellows and share the things that we have done.

For those reasons we are using this strategy.

## How to use this guide

### Order of the classes

This guide was developed to be consumed in a linear approach. What does this mean? That you should complete one course at a time.

The courses are **already** in the order that you should complete them. Just start in the **Introduction** section and after finishing the first course, start the next one.

**If the course isn't open, do it anyway with the resources from the previous class.**

### Should I take all courses?

**Yes**! The intention is to conclude **all** the courses listed here!

### Duration of the project

It may take longer to complete all of the classes compared to a  regular CS course, but I can **guarantee** you that your **reward** will be proportional to **your motivation/dedication**!

### How can I track my progress?

You should create a repository on GitHub to put all of the files that you created for each course.

You can create one repository per course, or just one repository that will contain all of the files for each course. The first option is our preferred approach.

### Cooperative work

**We love cooperative work**! But is quite difficult to manage a large base of students with specific projects. Use our channels to communicate with other fellows to combine and create new projects.

### Which programming languages should I use?

My friend, here is the best part of liberty! You can use **any** language that you want to complete the courses.

The **important** thing for each course is to **internalize** the **core concepts** and to be able to use them with whatever tool (programming language) that you wish.

### Stay tuned

[Watch](https://help.github.com/articles/watching-repositories/) this repository for futures improvements and general information.

## Prerequisite

The **only things** that you need to know are how to use **Git** and **GitHub**. Here are some resources to learn about them:

- [Try Git](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1)
- [GitHub Training & Guides](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLg7s6cbtAD15G8lNyoaYDuKZSKyJrgwB-)
- [GitHub Hello World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)
- [Git Immersion](http://gitimmersion.com/index.html)
- [How to Use Git and GitHub](https://www.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775)

**ps**: You don't need to do all of the courses. Just pick one and learn the basics because you will learn more on the go!

## How to collaborate

You can [open an issue](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/) and give us your suggestions as to how we can improve this guide, or what we can do to improve the learning experience.

You can also fork this project and fix any mistakes that you have found.

Let's do it together! =)

## Community

Join us in our [group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/open-source-society-university)!

You can also interact through [GitHub issues](https://github.com/open-source-society/computer-science-and-engineering/issues).

> **ps**: A forum is an ideal way to interact with other students as we do not lose important discussions, which usually occur in communication via chat apps.

## Next Goals

- [Adding our university page at Linkedin](https://help.linkedin.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/40128/~/adding-a-new-university-page), so that way we will be able to add **OSS University** in our Linkedin profile.
